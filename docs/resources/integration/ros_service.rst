Creating ROS services
*********************

| This page provides a step-by-step guide to create a ROS service from already existing code. Note that this tutorial includes some specific steps that ensures your service can be used by GRIP!
|
| Let's consider that you have a script that randomly generates the position of the end-effector of the robot within a given area. To do so, let's assume that you have the following python code:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import random

    def generate_ee_position(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z):
        """
            Generate a random position within the input area
        """
        x_value = random.uniform(min_x, max_x)
        y_value = random.uniform(min_y, max_y)
        z_value = random.uniform(min_z, max_z)

        return [x_value, y_value, z_value]

The C++ equivalent of this code would be the following:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <random>
    #include <vector>

    // You can define here as many functions as you want

    float random_float(float min, float max)
    {
        // this  function assumes max > min, you may want
        // more robust error checking for a non-debug build
        assert(max > min);
        float random = ((float) rand()) / (float) RAND_MAX;

        float range = max - min;
        return (random * range) + min;
    }

    std::vector<float> generate_ee_position(float min_x, float max_x, float min_y, float max_y, float min_z, float max_z)
    {
        float x_value = random_float(min_x, max_x);
        float y_value = random_float(min_y, max_y);
        float z_value = random_float(min_z, max_z);

        std::vector<float> output_vector{ x_value, y_value, z_value };

        return output_vector;
    }

The following instructions hold whether your code is implmented in C++ or Python!

1. Copy the server_template folder
##################################
Instead of creating a ROS package from scratch, we are going to start from an existing one. First create an empty folder in :code:`/home/projects/shadow/base/src`, which name will be the name of the ROS package containing your code and copy the content of this `repository <https://github.com/ARQ-CRISP/server_template.git>`_ inside it. You can also initialize a repository if you want to keep it in git. In our case, we named our ROS package :code:`example_package`. This folder contains five folders and seven files, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    +-- action
    |
    +-- include
    |   +-- server_template
    |       template_action_server.hpp
    |
    +-- msg
    |
    +-- scripts
    |   template_action_server.cpp
    |   template_action_server.py
    |   template_service_server.cpp
    |   template_service_server.py
    |
    +-- srv
    CMakeLists.txt
    package.xml

If your code is written in C++, all the headers (**.hpp** files) must be placed in :code:`/include/server_template`, while your **.cpp** files can be located in :code:`scripts`. If you are using python, just add your **.py** files in :code:`scripts`.

2. Change the package description
#################################
| Replace all the information (i.e. the description, the maintainer, the author and the name) of the :code:`package.xml` file. In line 2 of :code:`CMakeLists.txt`, modify what's inside :code:`project()`. The name inside :code:`project()` in the :code:`CMakeLists.txt` and the name inside :code:`<name>` tage of :code:`package.xml` **must correspond to the name of your folder!**. We encourage you to just replace :code:`server_template` by the name of your package in those two files.

.. warning::
    Make sure to change the name of the folder in :code:`include` as well!

| To make sure everything is working fine, please run the following:

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd /home/projects/shadow_robot/base
    catkin_make

If it does not finish successfully, it might be that the name of the folder and the name you changed in :code:`package.xml` and :code:`CMakeLists.txt` don't match!

3. Create msg and srv files
###########################
| The **srv** file will contain the backbone of what should be received and sent by the server. In order to be fully compatible with GRIP, the srv file **must** respect the following format:

.. code-block:: bash

    <msg_type> input
    ---
    int8 outcome
    <msg_type> returned_object

| :code:`<msg_type>` is left to your preference, i.e. it's implementation-dependent. You can use all the `built-in types <http://wiki.ros.org/msg>`_ or :ref:`create your own msg file <create_msg>`.
| In our case, the function we want to wrap inside a ROS service expects 6 values as input and outputs 3 values. For this reason, we are going to create a new file, :code:`GeneratePosition.srv`, in the :code:`srv` folder with the following content

.. code-block:: bash

    float32[] input
    ---
    int8 outcome
    float32[] returned_object

| Before forgetting, let's edit the :code:`CMakeLists.txt` file. Go to line 67 and add the name of your srv file after :code:`FILES` (if you have several, add one per line). In our case, we would get

.. code-block:: CMake

    add_service_files(
      FILES
      GeneratePosition.srv
    )

| To make sure everything works so far, run

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd /home/user/projects/shadow_robot/base
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

4. Filling the templates
########################
| If the code you want to wrap inside ROS services is written in C++, you will find the :code:`template_service_server.cpp` file in :code:`scripts`. If you are using python, the template file is :code:`template_service_server.py`. Although the syntaxes are different, the steps are exactly the same (and described in the files). You can either copy/paste and rename these files or just rename them. In our case we are going to create the file :code:`generate_ee_position_server.py` (python version) and :code:`generate_ee_position_server.cpp` (C++ version).

4.1 Import the generated srv files
**********************************
Make sure to change the occurences of :code:`server_template` by your package name (e.g. :code:`example_package`). Then, change :code:`srvName` by the name of your srv file without the extension (e.g. :code:`GeneratePosition`).

4.2 Add your code
*****************
| Add your code in the file. It can either directly be inside the function :code:`my_function` (feel free to change its name), or create a new function, class or whatever you prefer.
| **In Python**, if you want to access the values stored in the :code:`input` field of your srv file inside :code:`my_function`, you can use :code:`input_values = request.input` and carry out any operation on the variable :code:`input_values`.
| Similarly, **in C++**, you can use :code:`<variable_type> input_values = request.input;`.

4.3 Return the result
*********************
Make sure to fill and return the response of your server, keeping in mind that it must contain the fields :code:`outcome` and :code:`returned_object`.

4.4 Call your code when the script is executed
**********************************************
Change the name of the ROS node that will run your server (string inside :code:`rospy.init_node()` or :code:`ros::init()`). The last step is to make sure its content is valid. The first argument sets the **name of the service**, the second one (not in C++) should be the **name of your srv file** and the last one should be the **name of the function returning the server response**.

In our example, the :code:`generate_ee_position_server.py` looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import rospy
    # Change server_template by the name of your ROS package and srvName by the name of your srv file (without the .srv)
    from example_package.srv import GeneratePosition, GeneratePositionResponse

    # You can add here any other import statement you might need for your code
    import random


    # You can define here as many functions as you want
    def generate_ee_position(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z):
        """
            Generate a random position within the input area
        """
        x_value = random.uniform(min_x, max_x)
        y_value = random.uniform(min_y, max_y)
        z_value = random.uniform(min_z, max_z)

        return [x_value, y_value, z_value]


    # Function that is going to be linked to the service server
    def randomly_generate_end_effector_position(request):
        """
            This function (feel free to change its name) must contain your code.
            It MUST have a single input argument, that will be the request part of the srv, so DO NOT change it.
            You can call other functions inside it without any problem
        """
        # Change srvName by the name of your srv
        response = GeneratePositionResponse()

        # Get the input list
        input_values = request.input
        # Make sure the input list has 6 values, otherwise fill the response with a negative outcome (indexed as 1 here)
        if len(input_values) != 6:
            response.outcome = 1
            # Return an empty list
            response.returned_object = list()
        else:
            response.returned_object = generate_ee_position(input_values[0], input_values[1], input_values[2],
                                                            input_values[3], input_values[4], input_values[5])
            # Success outcome
            response.outcome = 0
        # Return the response
        return response

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Initialise the node with a specific name (please change it to match your service)
        rospy.init_node('python_generate_ee_position_service_server')
        # Set the name of the service, specify which kind of srv will trigger it and what function will be run.
        # Change the name of the server with one that matches the content of your code, set the second argument to the name
        # of the srv file, and the last one should be the name of the function that runs your code.
        service = rospy.Service("ee_position_generation", GeneratePosition, randomly_generate_end_effector_position)
        rospy.spin()

Similarly, here is the content of :code:`generate_ee_position_server.cpp`:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ros/ros.h>
    /**
    Change server_template by the name of your ROS package and srvName by the name of your srv file (without the .srv)
    */
    #include <example_package/GeneratePosition.h>

    // You can add here any other include statement you might need for your code
    #include <random>
    #include <vector>

    // You can define here as many functions as you want

    float random_float(float min, float max)
    {
        // this function assumes max > min, you may want more robust error checking for a non-debug build
        assert(max > min);
        float random = ((float) rand()) / (float) RAND_MAX;

        float range = max - min;
        return (random * range) + min;
    }

    std::vector<float> generate_ee_position(float min_x, float max_x, float min_y, float max_y, float min_z, float max_z)
    {
        float x_value = random_float(min_x, max_x);
        float y_value = random_float(min_y, max_y);
        float z_value = random_float(min_z, max_z);

        std::vector<float> output_vector{ x_value, y_value, z_value };

        return output_vector;
    }

    // Function that is going to be linked to the service server
    // This function (feel free to change its name) must contain your code.
    // It MUST have two paramters, one for the request the srv, and the other one for the response.
    // You can call other functions inside it without any problem
    bool randomly_generate_end_effector_position(example_package::GeneratePosition::Request &request,
                                                 example_package::GeneratePosition::Response &response)
    {
      // Get the input list
      std::vector<float> input_values = request.input;

      // Make sure the input list has 6 values, otherwise fill the response with a negative outcome (indexed as 1 here)
      if (input_values.size() != 6)
      {
        response.outcome = 1;
        // Return an empty list
        std::vector<float> empty_vector;
        response.returned_object = empty_vector;
      }
      else
      {
        response.returned_object = generate_ee_position(input_values[0], input_values[1], input_values[2],
                                                        input_values[3], input_values[4], input_values[5]);
        // Success outcome
        response.outcome = 0;
      }

      // Return true to avoid having runtime errors on the client side
      return true;
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {

      ros::NodeHandle node_handle;
      /**
      Set the name of the service and what function will be run and received

      */
      ros::ServiceServer service = node_handle.advertiseService("ee_position_generation", randomly_generate_end_effector_position);
      ros::spin();

      return 0;
    }

5. Make sure the server is executable
#####################################

5.1 For Python
**************
If you have created your server from :code:`template_service_server.py`, be sure to make your new file executable with :code:`chmod +x`:

.. prompt:: bash $

    chmod +x /home/user/projects/shadow_robot/base/src/example_package/scripts/generate_ee_position_server.py

Otherwise, ROS won't be able to locate your node.

5.2 For C++
***********
In order to make ROS aware of your newly created server, we need to slightly modify :code:`CMakeLists.txt`. In the **Build** section of this file (you can go to line 167), add these three lines for **each** cpp service file you have created:

.. code-block:: CMake

    add_executable(<node_name> scripts/<cpp_file_name>)
    target_link_libraries(<node_name> ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
    add_dependencies(<node_name> <package_name>)

In our case, we would have:

.. code-block:: CMake

    add_executable(cpp_generate_ee_position_service_server scripts/generate_ee_position_server.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(cpp_generate_ee_position_service_server ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
    add_dependencies(cpp_generate_ee_position_service_server example_package)

5.3 Common step
***************
The last thing you need to do is to recompile your ROS package:

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd /home/projects/shadow_robot/base
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

And here you are! You have successfully wrapped your code in a ROS service **fully compatible** with GRIP!
